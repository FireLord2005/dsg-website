- Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) often leads to issues like catastrophic
forgetting, overfitting, or high computational costs.
- We propose a pipeline for finetuning diffusion models using low rank adaptation using 3 to 4 images of the subject.
  
## 1. Generative models

A generative model could generate new photos of animals that look like real animals, while a discriminative model could tell a dog from a cat.

## 2. Diffusion models
![diffusion model]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/diffusion.jpg)
A class of generative AI models that create synthetic data, like images, by gradually adding noise to existing data and then learning to reverse this process, reconstructing or generating new data

## 4. Low Rank Adaptation(LoRA)
![Lora]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lora.png)
LoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that injects trainable low-rank matrices into a frozen pre-trained model.

## 5. Our pipeline
![ImageAlchemy]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/research/ImageAlchemy.png)
In this project we developed a two-stage pipeline using LoRA-based fine-tuning on SDXLs attention layers, followed by a segmentation-driven Img2Img
approach to insert personalized subjects while preserving the models generative capabilities.
